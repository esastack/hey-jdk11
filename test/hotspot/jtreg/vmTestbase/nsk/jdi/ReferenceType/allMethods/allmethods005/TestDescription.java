 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jdi]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DESCRIPTION
 *     This test checks that the JDI method
 *        com.sun.jdi.ReferenceType.allMethods()
 *     properly returns an empty list for arrays (ArrayType) and primitive
 *     classes.
 *     Debugger part of it attempts to get a list of methods in several
 *     reference types corresponding to debuggee field values, which are:
 *     primitive classes themselves, and arrays of primitive types and classes.
